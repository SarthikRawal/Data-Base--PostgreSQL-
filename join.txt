JOIN in sql.

1. Inner Join - returns records that have matching values in both tables.

syntax:
> SELECT column_name(s) 
  FROM tableA
  INNER JOIN tableB
  ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

> SELECT * FROM cutomers AS c
  INNER JOIN payments AS p
  ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
  
2. Left Join - return all the records from the left table and matching values from the right table

syntax:
> SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM tableA
  LEFT JOIN tableB
  ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
  
> SELECT * 
  FROM customer AS c
  LEFT JOIN payments AS p
  ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
  
3. Right Join - returns all the records from the right table and matching values from the left table

syntax:
> SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM tableB
  RIGHT JOIN tableA
  ON tableb.col_name = tableA.col_name;\
  
> SELECT * 
  FROM payments AS p
  RIGHT JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id;
  
 4. Full Join - returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
 
syntax:
> SELECT *
  FROM tableA
  FULL OUTER JOIN tableB
  ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
  
> SELECT *
  FROM customer AS c
  FULL OUTER JOIN payment AS p
  ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;

5. Cross Join - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows.

> SELECT student.student_id, student.first_name, student.last_name, course.course_name
  FROM student
  CROSS JOIN course;
